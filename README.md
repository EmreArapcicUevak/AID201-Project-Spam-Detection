# SMS Spam Detection Project (AID201)

This repository contains the implementation of a **Spam Detection system** developed as part of the **AID201 course project**.  
The project focuses on building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models to classify messages as **Spam** or **Ham**.

A key outcome of this project is an **interactive Streamlit web application** that allows users to try the model live.

Try out the Streamlit app [here](https://aid201-project-spam-detection.streamlit.app)
